Best Friends Animal Society is a leading animal welfare organization dedicated to saving the lives of dogs and cats in America's shelters and making the entire country no-kill by 2025.

Founded in 1984, Best Friends runs lifesaving facilities and programs nationwide in partnership with more than 5,000 shelters and rescue organizations. From our headquarters in Kanab, Utah, they also operate the nation's largest no-kill animal sanctuary — a destination that brings our mission to life for thousands of visitors each year. They maintain the most comprehensive animal sheltering data in the country and make it accessible to the public — empowering communities with critical insights into the needs of their local shelters and how they can help. They believe every dog and cat deserves a home and that, by working together, we can Save Them All®.
