### About Tab for Black Equity

**Tab for Black Equity** is proud to support The Bail Project and Thurgood Marshall College Fund. With each tab opened, you are making a positive impact toward Black equity and empowerment.

[The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/) is a 501(c)(3) organization that works to combat mass incarceration through the money bail system. [The reality is](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLcbMG1gX0A/) that Black people are 25% more likely to be kept in jail pretrial without bail than other groups of people, and Black men have bail amounts 35% higher than white men. Through providing bail and additional pretrial support, The Bail Project helps restore the presumption of innocence to those being charged, reunites families, and challenges a system that criminalizes poverty and race.

[The Thurgood Marshall College Fund](https://www.tmcf.org/) is a 501(c)(3) organization that advocates for students and public Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), provides scholarships, and supports educational and career-driven programs. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of workforce talent through leadership development.
