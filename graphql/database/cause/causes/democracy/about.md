**VoteAmerica** works to strengthen American democracy by removing barriers to voting. The end result is a larger and more diverse electorate – one that is better prepared to hold lawmakers accountable. They have a three-prong approach:

1. **Software Development**: They build easy-to-use software that helps people navigate needlessly complicated voting processes.
2. **Voter Registration and Mobilization**: They run large-scale voter registration and mobilization campaigns. They are goal-oriented and tactic-agnostic, which means they’ll abandon any tactic that stops producing results.
3. **Impact Litigation**: They engage in impact litigation against states that pass voter suppression laws. They recently won lawsuits against Kansas and Georgia.
