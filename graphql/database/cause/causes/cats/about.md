### About the Cause

Tab for Cats is proud to support Greater Good Charities' **The Jackson Galaxy Project**. With each tab opened, you are working toward a cat in need finding its fur-ever home.

[Greater Good Charities](https://greatergood.org/about-us) is an independent 501(c)(3) organization that works toward improving the well-being of people, pets, and the planet through its own programs and charitable donations to programs worldwide working toward its mission.

[The Jackson Galaxy Project](https://greatergood.org/jackson-galaxy) is a 501(c)(3) organization supported by Greater Good Charities that works to improve the lives of animals at risk and help the people who are caring for them. It aims to increase cat adoption rates by instructing shelter/rescue staff and volunteers how to implement positive reinforcement training for cats and by creating environments that help transform “unadoptable” cats into confident cats.

**Your tabs are having an impact.** The counter on your new tab page (with the cute paw icon!) estimates how many cat treats you have helped the program purchase. The Jackson Galaxy Project uses treats as positive reinforcement to train cats to be confident and ultimately more likely to be adopted. Thank you for making a difference!
