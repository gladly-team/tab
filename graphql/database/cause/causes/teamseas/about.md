### About #TeamSeas

**Tab for #TeamSeas** is proud to support the internet-led initiative **[#TeamSeas](https://teamseas.org)** to help raise \$30 million to clean up 30 million pounds of trash from oceans, rivers, and lakes around the world. To do this, #TeamSeas has directly partnered with The Ocean Cleanup and Ocean Conservancy.

[The Ocean Cleanup](http://theoceancleanup.com) is #TeamSeas' implementation partner for rivers. The Ocean Cleanup has developed technology that is helping clean up pollution in our rivers and has a goal of achieving a 90% reduction of floating ocean plastic by 2040.

[Ocean Conservancy](http://oceanconservancy.org) is #TeamSeas' implementation partner for beaches and oceans. Ocean Conservancy uses science to tackle challenges regarding ocean conservation and works to strengthen ocean health to ensure a better future. Ocean Conservancy also empowers citizens to facilitate change through the International Coastal Cleanup (ICC), one of the world's largest volunteer cleanup efforts for the ocean.

**Your tabs are having an impact.** The counter on your new tab page (with the awesome jellyfish icon) estimates how many plastic water bottles' worth of trash, by weight, your tabs have helped remove from our oceans. In partnership with The Ocean Cleanup and Ocean Conservancy, #TeamSeas will help remove 1lb of trash from the ocean for every \$1 raised. Thank you for making a difference!
